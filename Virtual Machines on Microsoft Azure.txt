Creating Windows and Linux Virtual Machines on Microsoft Azure
________________


* A Windows 11 VM
* An Ubuntu Linux VM
________________


Open the Azure Portal
1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
2. From the dashboard, click Virtual Machines or Create a resource
  

________________


Create a Resource Group
1. Click Resource groups in the left menu
2. Click + Create
3. Name the group RG-Network-Activities (any name that you want)
4. Set Region to (US) East US 2
5. Click Review + create, then click Create
  

________________


Create a Windows Virtual Machine
1. Go to Virtual Machines
2. Click + Create → Azure virtual machine
3. Select the Resource Group RG-Network-Activities

Configure the Windows VM
Basic Tab Setup:
* VM Name: windows-vm (any name that you want).
* Region: East US 2 (same region as the Resource Group for purposes of this exercise)
* Availability Zone: Zone 1
* Image: Windows 11 Pro, version 24H2 - x64 Gen2
* Size: Standard_D2s_v3
* Security Type: Trusted launch virtual machines
* Username: labuser
* Password: Your secure password
* Public inbound ports: Allow RDP (3389)
* Be sure to click the confirm that you have eligible Windows 10/11 license with multi-tenant hosting rights at the bottom of the screen
* Disk, Networking, Management, Monitoring, Advanced & Tags (for purposes of this exercise we’ll skip these steps, we don’t need to change or add anything here)
* Click Review & Create and start the deployment process
* After clicking review and create and after the Validation Test has passed
  

  

Deployment Configuration Completion
*  It is good practice to go back to the Virtual Machines and double check the VM is running

Create a Linux Virtual Machine
4. Go to Virtual Machines
5. Click + Create → Azure virtual machine
6. Select the Resource Group RG-Network-Activities
  







________________


Basic Tab Setup:
* VM Name: linux-vm
* Image: Ubuntu Server 22.04 or 24.04 LTS
* Authentication Type: Password
* Username: labuser
* Password: Your secure password
* Public inbound ports: Allow SSH (22)
* Keep the other settings consistent with the Windows VM
  

________________


Configure Disks
* Disk Type: Premium SSD
* Leave default size and redundancy (locally-redundant)
* Check the option to Delete disk when VM is deleted
  

________________
Configure Networking
* Virtual Network: We’ll use the windows-vm network that  we just created
* Public IP: Automatically assigned
* NIC Security Group: Basic
* Public inbound ports:
   * Windows VM: RDP (3389)
   * Linux VM: SSH (22)
* Leave Accelerated Networking enabled
  

________________


Why We Skip the Remaining Tabs (Management, Monitoring, Advanced, Tags)
These tabs are optional and not necessary for basic setups or practice labs:
* Management: Enables auto-shutdown, backup, and diagnostics, useful later but not needed for testing.
* Monitoring: You can configure insights and metrics later if desired.
* Advanced: Not required unless you need VM extensions or custom scripts.
* Tags: Useful in enterprise environments for cost tracking, optional for personal use.
________________


Review and Create
* Azure runs a validation check.
* If successful, click Create to begin deployment.
  

________________


Deployment Progress
Azure will begin provisioning resources:
* Virtual Network
* Subnet
* NSG (Network Security Group)
* Public IP
* Disk and NIC
  

________________


Deployment Complete
After a few minutes, you’ll see Deployment Succeeded.
Click Go to resource to view your new virtual machine.
  

________________


Verify Virtual Machines
Go back to the Virtual Machines panel.
Confirm both windows-vm and linux-vm show status as Running and have public IP addresses assigned.

Best Practices
* Shutdown unused VMs to avoid charges
* Use NSG rules to secure access (don’t allow all IPs in production)
* Consider Azure Bastion or VPN for secure remote access
* Use Tags when working with multiple environments or users
